        Years pass and the princes return to Hastinapur, where they are engaged in a competition of showcasing their skills.
        Arjuna wins the competition, but Karna challenges Arjuna as Dronacharya declared Arjuna as the greatest bowman of the
        world. Kunti realises that Karna is her son whom she had obtained from Surya, the Sun God, long before marriage. In the
        meantime, Arjuna , also befriends Lord Krishna , his cousin (Lord Krishna 's father was Vasudev, brother of Kunti), and
        King of Dwarka. The Kauravas attempt to kill the Pandavas using a palace made of wax, but the Pandavas escape. They go
        into exile so all others believe them to be dead. In the process, the Pandavas encounter a demon by the name Hidimba.
        Bhima kills Hidimba but ends up marrying his sister, Hidimbi. The couple begets a son, Ghatotkacha. Arjune disguised as
        a Brahmin wins Draupadi in her Swayamvar arranged by her father, the King of Panchal, Drupad. Arjuna takes her to his
        mother who was doing Pooja and without realising what he was talking about commands him to share whatever he has won
        with his brothers. The Pandavas eventually marry Draupadi , the princess of Panchala and King Drupada's daughter, born
        from fire, thus revealing their identity. They return to Hastinapur and justify their polyandry.The sequence of events
        leads to the Kuru Kingdom being divided - The Pandavas receive a new kingdom - Khandavprastha. Arjuna destroys the
        Khandava. They renovate the town, and rename it as Indraprastha. The prosperity of Indraprastha angers Duryodhana. A
        jealous Duryodhana summons Pandavas for a dice game, where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, brothers as well as their
        common wife Draupadi . Draupadi is dragged and humiliated in the court, however, Krishna saves her honour at the
        end.Shortly before the Kurukshetra War commences, Arjuna obtains the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita from Krishna , which
        helps him fight for righteousness without any remorse of killing his own people in the process. The war begins and
        continues for 18 days - both sides face mass destruction. The Pandavas and Kauravas lose all of their children, in-laws,
        and allies, and the war officially ends after Duryodhana, the only remaining Kaurava, is killed by Bhima.

    <p>Introduction to browser events
    An event is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals (but events are not limited to
    DOM).
    
    Here’s a list of the most useful DOM events, just to take a look at:
    
    Mouse events:
    
    click – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).
    contextmenu – when the mouse right-clicks on an element.
    mouseover / mouseout – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.
    mousedown / mouseup – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.
    mousemove – when the mouse is moved.
    Keyboard events:
    
    keydown and keyup – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.
    Form element events:
    
    submit – when the visitor submits a <form>.
        focus – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an <input>.
        Document events:
    
        DOMContentLoaded – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.</p>
