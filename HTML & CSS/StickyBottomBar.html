        Years pass and the princes return to Hastinapur, where they are engaged in a competition of showcasing their
        skills.
        Arjuna wins the competition, but Karna challenges Arjuna as Dronacharya declared Arjuna as the greatest bowman
        of the
        world. Kunti realises that Karna is her son whom she had obtained from Surya, the Sun God, long before marriage.
        In the
        meantime, Arjuna , also befriends Lord Krishna , his cousin (Lord Krishna 's father was Vasudev, brother of
        Kunti), and
        King of Dwarka. The Kauravas attempt to kill the Pandavas using a palace made of wax, but the Pandavas escape.
        They go
        into exile so all others believe them to be dead. In the process, the Pandavas encounter a demon by the name
        Hidimba.
        Bhima kills Hidimba but ends up marrying his sister, Hidimbi. The couple begets a son, Ghatotkacha. Arjune
        disguised as
        a Brahmin wins Draupadi in her Swayamvar arranged by her father, the King of Panchal, Drupad. Arjuna takes her
        to his
        mother who was doing Pooja and without realising what he was talking about commands him to share whatever he has
        won
        with his brothers. The Pandavas eventually marry Draupadi , the princess of Panchala and King Drupada's
        daughter, born
        from fire, thus revealing their identity. They return to Hastinapur and justify their polyandry.The sequence of
        events
        leads to the Kuru Kingdom being divided - The Pandavas receive a new kingdom - Khandavprastha. Arjuna destroys
        the
        Khandava. They renovate the town, and rename it as Indraprastha. The prosperity of Indraprastha angers
        Duryodhana. A
        jealous Duryodhana summons Pandavas for a dice game, where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, brothers as well as
        their
        common wife Draupadi . Draupadi is dragged and humiliated in the court, however, Krishna saves her honour at the
        end.Shortly before the Kurukshetra War commences, Arjuna obtains the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita from Krishna
        , which
        helps him fight for righteousness without any remorse of killing his own people in the process. The war begins
        and
        continues for 18 days - both sides face mass destruction. The Pandavas and Kauravas lose all of their children,
        in-laws,
        and allies, and the war officially ends after Duryodhana, the only remaining Kaurava, is killed by Bhima.

    <p>The epic begins with the sage Vālmīki asking Nārada if there is a righteous man still left in the world, to which Nārada
    replies that such a man is Rāma. After seeing two birds being shot, Vālmīki creates a new form of meter called śloka,
    and then is granted the ability to compose an epic poem about Rāma. He teaches his poem to the boys Lava and Kuśa, who
    recite it throughout the land and eventually at the court of king Rāma, which then begins the main narrative.[23]
    
    Daśaratha was the King of Ayodhyā. He had three wives: Kausalyā, Kaikeyī, and Sumitrā. He did not have a son and in the
    desire to have a legal heir performs a fire sacrifice known as Putrīyā Iṣṭi. Meanwhile, the gods are petitioning to
    Brahmā and Viṣṇu about Rāvaṇa, king of the rākṣasas who is terrorizing the universe. Thus Viṣṇu had opted to be born
    into mortality to combat the demon Rāvaṇa. As a consequence, Rāma was first born to Kausalyā, Bharata was born to
    Kaikeyī, Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna were born to Sumitrā.</p>
